Draft version of SEIR-SEI model for *Vesicular stomatitis* transmission between equid hosts and *Culicoides* spp vectors.  Model includes Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed compartments for equids and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected compartments for vectors.  Vectors populations have a defined mortality rates.
